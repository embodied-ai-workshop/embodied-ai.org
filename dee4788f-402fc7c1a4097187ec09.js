To support this task, we create an automated infrastructure to generate paired egocentric tours of initial/modified layouts in the Habitat simulator using Matterport3D scenes, YCB and Google-scanned objects. We present 3D Semantic MapNet (3D-SMNet) – a two-stage re-identification model consisting of (1) a 3D object detector that operates on RGB-D videos with known pose, and (2) a differentiable object matching module that solves correspondence estimation between two sets of 3D bounding boxes. Overall, 3D-SMNet builds object-based maps of each layout and then uses a differentiable matcher to re-identify objects across the tours.

Collecting instruction-path annotation data is an expensive task. Additionally, humans can navigate without prior learning about the environment. Equipping an embodied agent with this ability is an important task for creating a general-purpose agent that can perform tasks in a variety of unfamiliar environments. In discrete environments, Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is performed through graph traversal, assuming collision-free movement between nodes. However, in continuous environments, navigation must be done through low-level actions to the destination, considering possible collisions. We propose the zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Collision Mitigation (VLN-CM), which takes these considerations. VLN-CM is composed of four modules and predicts the direction and distance of the next movement at each step. We utilize large foundation models for each modules. To select the direction, we use the Attention Spot Predictor (ASP), View Selector (VS), and Progress Monitor (PM). The ASP employs a Large Language Model (e.g. ChatGPT) to split navigation instructions into attention spots, which are objects or scenes at the location to move to (e.g. a yellow door). The VS selects from panorama images provided at 30-degree intervals the one that includes the attention spot, using CLIP similarity. We then choose the angle of the selected image as the direction to move in. The PM uses a rule-based approach to decide which attention spot to focus on next, among multiple spots derived from the instructions. If the similarity between the current attention spot and the visual observations decreases consecutively at each step, the PM determines that the agent has passed the current spot and moves on to the next one. For selecting the distance to move, we employed the Open Map Predictor (OMP). The OMP uses panorama depth information to predict an occupancy mask. We then selected a collision-free distance in the predicted direction based on the occupancy mask. We evaluated our method using the validation data of VLN-CE. Our approach showed better performance than several baseline methods, and the OPM was effective in mitigating collisions for the agent.",authors:{"SeongJun Jeong":[],"Gi-Cheon Kang":[],"Joochan Kim":[],"Byoung-Tak Zhang":[]},affiliations:[],pdf:"/papers/2024/19_Zero_Shot_Vision_and_Langua.pdf"}),(0,b.Y)(_,{title:"From NeRFs to Gaussian Splats, and Back",abstract:"For robotics applications where there is a limited number of (typically ego-centric) views, parametric representations such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) generalize better than non-parametric ones such as Gaussian splatting (GS) to views that are very different from those in the training data; GS however can render much faster than NeRFs.

They are strong and precise, allowing us to manipulate complex tools and do very fine-grained dexterous motions but they are also soft, safe, and compliant. The combination of incredible strength, a tight kinematic structure with many degrees of freedom, and soft compliance makes them the perfect manipulator. Emulating the capabilities of the human hand through a robot has been a long-standing challenge. Robot hands have fallen into one of two categories: soft or rigid. Soft hands, while compliant and safe lack the precision and strength of human hands. Conversely, while rigid robot hands can match the precision and power of human hands, they can easily break and are not safe to deploy. Our proposed solution is to build a robotic hand, that can bridge the gap between these two categories. It is soft when required and strong enough to apply power. We call this hand LEAP Hand v2, a dexterous, low-cost anthropomorphic soft hand. LEAP Hand v2 features three distinctive elements that allow it to be a hybrid between rigid and soft hands, all the while remaining simple to produce and under $3000. Firstly, it achieves a balance of human-hand-like softness and stiffness, via a 3d printed soft exterior combined with a 3d printed internal bone structure. Moreover, LEAP Hand v2 incorporates two powered articulations in the foldable palm: one spanning the four fingers and another near the thumb—mimicking the essential palm flexibility for human-like grasping. Lastly, LEAP Hand v2 boasts a dexterous Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) kinematic structure, making it highly human-like, easy to assemble, and versatile for various tasks. Through thorough real-world experiments, we show that LEAP Hand v2 exceeds the capabilities of many existing robot hands for grasping, teleoperated control, and imitation learning.

One can provide examples explicitly or implicitly, or encourage intermediate reasoning steps to improve the performance of foundation models. However, those methods as applied to LLMs and VLMs still lack the theoretical guarantee and provable correctness. Our idea is to leverage the foundation of classical AI, i.e., knowledge representation and reasoning, to develop a prompting strategy that enables the VLMs to verify the correctness of an agent’s behavior at execution time, in the real world. Given the natural connection between planning symbols and human language, this paper investigates how pre-trained VLMs can assist the robot in realizing symbolic plans generated by classical planners, while avoiding the engineering efforts of checking the outcomes of each action. Specifically, we propose a novel closed-loop task planning and execution framework called DKPROMPT, which prompts VLMs using domain knowledge in PDDL, generating visually grounded, provably correct task plans. DKPROMPT leverages VLMs to detect action failures and verify action affordances towards successful plan execution. We take the advantage of the domain knowledge encoded in classical planners, including the actions defined by their effects and preconditions. By simply querying current observations against the action knowledge, similar to applying VLMs to Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, DKPROMPT can trigger the robot to repeat an unsuccessful action recovering from previous failures, or call the symbolic planner to generate a new valid plan. We conducted quantitative evaluations in the OmniGibson simulator, where we reused some tasks from the Behavior-1K benchmark. We provided predefined parameterized actions for DKPROMPT, as well as other baselines, and these actions are imperfect by nature, frequently causing situations. Experimental results demonstrate that DKPROMPT is able to recover from action failures and re-plan when situations occur.

Using THE COLOSSEUM, we compare 5 state-of-the-art manipulation models to reveal that their success rate degrades between 30-50% across these perturbation factors. When multiple perturbations are applied in unison, the success rate degrades ≥75%. We identify that changing the number of distractor objects, target object color, or lighting conditions are the perturbations that reduce model performance the most. To verify the ecological validity of our results, we show that our results in simulation are correlated (¯ R2 = 0.614) to similar perturbations in real-world experiments.

We first validate our design choice in the SoundSpaces simulator and show improvement on the Continuous AudioGoal navigation benchmark. We then collect real-world data to measure the spectral difference between the simulation and the real world by training AFP models that only take a specific frequency subband as input. We further propose a frequency-adaptive strategy that intelligently selects the best frequency band for prediction based on both the measured spectral difference and the energy distribution of the received audio, which improves the performance on the real data.

Existing LLM agent studies have aimed to enhance performance by augmenting memory, leveraging environmental textual information, or utilizing predefined action knowledge. However, these approaches have limitations; memory contents are not entirely understandable texts, they require textual environmental data, and they incur high costs. To address these issues, we propose environmental understanding generation using a multi-modal large language model (M-LLM).

As robots move into more unstructured environments such as homes, however, we need new techniques that allow robots to perform complex operations with less information about the world around them. We propose a motivating north star: Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation, wherein robots must be able to reliably perform pick and place tasks of any object in any location in an unknown environment. Currently, a variety of powerful approaches exist for learning low-level skills or performing long-horizon manipulation, but these often assume access to model-based object detection and grasp generation. However, new approaches exist which allow for robots to plan and manipulate novel objects - building structures and rearranging scenes - while reducing these assumptions about task and object knowledge. In this talk, I will discuss recent work on how to learn these representations, combine them with robot task and motion planning, and use them to work towards robots that can operate in complex, human environments.
